  What are you doing?
  I understand.
  You are not working!
  You are not 100% committed.
  What are you waiting for?
  Thinking is not working.
  That's what the client want.
  I'm a humble guy.
  Good job!
  Get the shit done.
  Just ship it.
  Nothing is impossible.
  You will take a day off?
  Do you understand it?
  Think out-of-the-box.
  See?
  This is not what I want.
  I do not want you to do that.
  This is not ridiculous to ask.
  Iâ€™m not saying that.
  What are you reading?
  I'm the manager because I'm smarter.
  You should do some overtime.
  You have Stock options!
  It's my fault.
